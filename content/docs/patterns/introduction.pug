        h2 Welcome to the application styleguide.

        p You are looking at a bare bones install of Bedrock.

        p This page is supposed to contain some content on why the styleguide exists. You can view examples of “real” style guides here:

        ul
            li: a(href="http://bs4base.bedrockapp.org/styleguide") Bedrock + Bootstrap 4
            li: a(href="http://materialbase.bedrockapp.org/styleguide") Bedrock + Material design

        p This part of the codebase is more like a unit test for people who develop Bedrock, or for someone who wants to make their own custom Bedrock base. Feel free to delete this template and enter your own styleguide introduction.
